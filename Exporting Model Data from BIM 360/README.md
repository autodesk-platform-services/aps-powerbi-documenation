# Exporting Model Data from BIM 360



Before setting up a BI report integrated with BIM 360 model and data, you need to configure your BIM 360 account to allow export of the data.

> **Note:** You only need to create this custom integration once for your BIM 360 Account. If an integration with the provided Forge Client ID already exists, you do not need to create another one.

1. Log in to your BIM 360 account.
2. Go to **Account Admin > SETTINGS > Custom Integrations**.
3. Click **Add Custom Integration**.
4. Make sure both **BIM 360 Account Administration** and **Document Management** are checked, and click **Next**. (Screenshot)
5. In the next screen select **Iâ€™m the developer**, and click **Next**.
6. Make sure **BIM 360 Account ID** is correct and **I have saved the Account ID information securely** is checked.
7. Under **Fill in App Information**, fill in the **APS Client ID** with the Client ID `NGqWcoPkbSCkOc4HZN14kAR7aIASSxnR`, and the **App Name** with `Endymion`. (Note: The **App Name** is actually ignored, so you can use anything you want.)
